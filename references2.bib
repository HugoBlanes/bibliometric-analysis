   abstract = {Introduction: This study explores the effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, with a particular focus on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, on Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). With the rapid advancement of AI, understanding its implications in the educational sector becomes paramount. Methods: Utilizing databases like PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar, we systematically searched for literature on AI chatbots’ impact on HEIs. Our criteria prioritized peer-reviewed articles, prominent media outlets, and English publications, excluding tangential AI chatbot mentions. After selection, data extraction focused on authors, study design, and primary findings. The analysis combined descriptive and thematic approaches, emphasizing patterns and applications of AI chatbots in HEIs. Results: The literature review revealed diverse perspectives on ChatGPT’s potential in education. Notable benefits include research support, automated grading, and enhanced human-computer interaction. However, concerns such as online testing security, plagiarism, and broader societal and economic impacts like job displacement, the digital literacy gap, and AI-induced anxiety were identified. The study also underscored the transformative architecture of ChatGPT and its versatile applications in the educational sector. Furthermore, potential advantages like streamlined enrollment, improved student services, teaching enhancements, research aid, and increased student retention were highlighted. Conversely, risks such as privacy breaches, misuse, bias, misinformation, decreased human interaction, and accessibility issues were identified. Discussion: While AI’s global expansion is undeniable, there is a pressing need for balanced regulation in its application within HEIs. Faculty members are encouraged to utilize AI tools like ChatGPT proactively and ethically to mitigate risks, especially academic fraud. Despite the study’s limitations, including an incomplete representation of AI’s overall effect on education and the absence of concrete integration guidelines, it is evident that AI technologies like ChatGPT present both significant benefits and risks. The study advocates for a thoughtful and responsible integration of such technologies within HEIs.},

   abstract = {Background: The use of remote online delivery of summative assessments has been underexplored in medical education. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all end of year applied knowledge multiple choice question (MCQ) tests at one UK medical school were switched from on campus to remote assessments. Methods: We conducted an online survey of student experience with remote exam delivery and compared test performance in remote versus invigilated campus-based forms of similar assessments for Year 4 and 5 students across two academic years. Results: Very few students experienced technical or practical problems in completing their exam remotely. Test anxiety was reduced for some students but increased for others. The majority of students preferred the traditional setting of invigilated exams in a computer lab, feeling this ensured an even playing field for all candidates. Mean score was higher for Year 4 students in the remotely-delivered versus campus-based form of the same exam (76.53% [SD 6.57] vs. 72.81% [6.64]; t438.38 = 5.94, p = 0.001; d = 0.56), whereas candidate performance was equivalent across both forms for Year 5 students. Conclusions: Remote online MCQ exam delivery is an effective and generally acceptable approach to summative assessment, and could be used again in future without detriment to students if onsite delivery is not possible.},

   abstract = {Background: Online and blended learning need an appropriate assessment strategy which ensures academic integrity. During the pandemic, many universities have chosen for online proctoring. Although some earlier examples suggest that online proctoring may reduce cheating, the potential side-effects of proctoring are largely unknown. Objectives: Therefore, this study aims to identify the effects of proctoring on students' self-reported temptation to cheat and potentially undesirable side-effects, including test anxiety, perceived exam difficulty, and performance. In addition, we examine which contextual and student characteristics affect test anxiety during online exams. Methods: For this, we collected four waves of survey data throughout a year of teaching during the pandemic at one faculty of a Dutch university, resulting in a total sample of 1760 students within 105 courses. Results and Conclusions: Multi-level analyses showed that while proctoring had no effect on the temptation to cheat, exam difficulty or performance, students reported higher levels of test anxiety. Some learning strategies, internet literacy, access to a reliable technology and a dedicated study space as well as gender and financial stress affect their test anxiety. To conclude, the decision to use online proctoring needs to consider the undesirable side-effect on test anxiety. We discuss practical implications for university administrators, educational designers and teachers to reduce test anxiety.},

   abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected assessment practices in medical education necessitating distancing from the traditional classroom. However, safeguarding academic integrity is of particular importance for high-stakes medical exams. We utilised remote proctoring to administer safely and reliably a proficiency-test for admission to the Advanced Master of General Practice (AMGP). We compared exam results of the remote proctored exam group to those of the on-site proctored exam group. Methods: A cross-sectional design was adopted with candidates applying for admission to the AMGP. We developed and applied a proctoring software operating on three levels to register suspicious events: recording actions, analysing behaviour, and live supervision. We performed a Mann-Whitney U test to compare exam results from the remote proctored to the on-site proctored group. To get more insight into candidates’ perceptions about proctoring, a post-test questionnaire was administered. An exploratory factor analysis was performed to explore quantitative data, while qualitative data were thematically analysed. Results: In total, 472 (79%) candidates took the proficiency-test using the proctoring software, while 121 (20%) were on-site with live supervision. The results indicated that the proctoring type does not influence exam results. Out of 472 candidates, 304 filled in the post-test questionnaire. Two factors were extracted from the analysis and identified as candidates’ appreciation of proctoring and as emotional distress because of proctoring. Four themes were identified in the thematic analysis providing more insight on candidates’ emotional well-being. Conclusions: A comparison of exam results revealed that remote proctoring could be a viable solution for administering high-stakes medical exams. With regards to candidates’ educational experience, remote proctoring was met with mixed feelings. Potential privacy issues and increased test anxiety should be taken into consideration when choosing a proctoring protocol. Future research should explore generalizability of these results utilising other proctoring systems in medical education and in other educational settings.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the use of remote teaching modality in higher education has become widespread. This has posed various challenges in different areas of learning, with one of them being associated with the development of oral competence. The objectives of this study were, first, to describe university students' perceptions of their oral communicative competence, and second, to describe their perceptions regarding their processes of self-assessment and peer assessment of their oral communicative competence. This research corresponds to a qualitative descriptive study. The sample consisted of 45 first-cycle students from the Faculty of Health Sciences who, in the 2023-1 semester, were taking the Communication course in the remote education modality. To achieve this, two data collection techniques were employed: documentary analysis of the self-assessment and peer assessment forms completed by the students, and a focus group directed at them. Among the findings, it was identified that bodily, oral, and content-related resources pose greater difficulties for students, with issues such as pronunciation, tone of voice, facial gestures, and the development of solid arguments standing out. The categories that emerged from this analysis were metacognitive skills, time management, and pedagogical support. It was concluded that both self-assessment and peer assessment are highly beneficial activities for the formation and improvement of oral communicative competence, and these should be framed within the application of didactic strategies aimed at the development of each of its components.},

Recent technological developments allowed to convert quantitative information from VR-systems into qualitative feedback messages that directly relate to the standards for high-quality feedback. This experimental field study, therefore, focuses on the impact of automated, qualitative feedback messages in a VR-system on students’ presentation skills development (n = 60). The effects are compared with a validated condition in which the delayed VR-feedback is delivered by an expert. Mixed methods, including validated rubrics and self-evaluation tests, are used for data collection. This study aims to refine educational design principles concerning effective feedback in presentation curricula. Furthermore, the results should provide insights about supporting feedback processes while releasing the pressure on resources such as time and staffing.},

   abstract = {Background: Self-regulated learning refers to the monitoring and controlling of one's own cognitive performance before, during, and after a learning episode. Previous literature suggested that self-regulated learning had a significant relationship with academic achievement, but not all self-regulated learning strategies exerted the same influences. Using an invalid strategy may waste the limited psychological resources, which will cause the ego depletion effect. The present meta-analysis study intended to search for the best self-regulated learning strategies and inefficient strategies for Chinese students in elementary and secondary school, and analyzed the critical phases of self-regulated learning according to Zimmerman's theory. The moderating effects of gender, grade, and publication year were also analyzed. Methods: Empirical studies which conducted in real teaching situations of elementary and secondary education were systematically searched using Chinese academic databases. Studies focused on undergraduate students, students of special education, or online learning environments were excluded. Fifty-five cross-sectional studies and four intervention studies (which generated 264 independent samples) were included with a total sample size of 23,497 participants. Random effects model was chosen in the current meta-analysis, and publication bias was also examined. Results: The results indicated that the overall effect size of self-regulated learning on academic achievement was small for primary and secondary school students in China. The effect sizes of self-efficacy, task strategies, and self-evaluation were relatively higher than other strategies. Self-regulated learning strategies have the largest effect size on science disciplines (including mathematics and physics). Performance phase and self-reflection phase are key phases of self-regulated learning. From 1998 to 2016, the effect size between self-regulated learning and academic achievement was gradually decreasing. Conclusions: The main findings of the current study showed that self-efficacy, task strategies, and self-evaluation were key self-regulated learning strategies for Chinese students. Performance phase and self-reflection phase played significant roles in the process of self-regulated learning. Future studies need to include more intervention studies with rigorous treatment fidelity control and provide more empirical evidence from online learning, so as to compare the different effects of self-regulated learning between traditional education and online education.},

   abstract = {Remote laboratories have been in use for 25 years now. Whereas several learning oriented meta-analyses exist, validated and agreed-upon tools for assessing the user experience are not readily available. The present paper fills this gap by designing and evaluating a questionnaire focused on the needs of remote labs developers and educators using them. Building from pre-existing tools, a first version of the User eXperience Questionnaire (UXQ version 20190308) was designed to contain four scales, usability, utility, satisfaction and immersion. A total of 180 completed responses were collected from two different remote labs (VISIR and FPGA), in different campuses and in different courses to evaluate the questionnaire. The questionnaire was analyzed in terms of reliability, using Cronbach's alpha and McDonalds' omega, and validity of construct, through factor analysis. The reliability of the questionnaire and its four subscales is acceptable, but its validity should be improved. Accordingly, the questionnaire was redesigned to obtain the User eXperience Questionnaire (UXQ version 20191126), which includes three scales: usability, utility and immersion, and three questions per scale. This questionnaire was assessed using the same data. Reliability coefficients are above 0.7 and construct validity is satisfactory. A new questionnaire to evaluate the user experience in remote laboratories has been designed and validated. The questionnaire, now renamed as UXQ4RL v. 1.0, is presented and made available in this paper.},

By integrating physical assets with Extended Reality (XR) technologies, XRLs provide an immersive remote laboratory experience. This study presents the development of Deusto XRL, a reference architecture for XRLs, and investigates User eXperience (UX) via a survey involving 150 high-school students. The participants were divided into groups and exposed to different online laboratory experiences: traditional Remote Laboratories (RLs) and XRLs. Feedback scores from the UX survey indicated that the XRLs received the highest ratings, reflecting a positive UX. The results highlight the potential of XRLs to enhance the accessibility and quality of science education, enabling students to engage in immersive learning experiences despite physical laboratory limitations. Future research endeavors will focus on exploring the educational implications and learning outcomes associated with XRL technology. By further investigating the pedagogical aspects of XRLs, this study aims to uncover their potential benefits and educational value. Implementing XRLs in educational settings can revolutionize science education, providing students with interactive and engaging opportunities to deepen their understanding of scientific concepts.},

With experiences, also our evaluation of a product can change, affecting whether we will recommend the product for others. Studying the long-term UX of products with retrospective methods offers an alternative to the resource demanding real-time studies. In this exploratory remote study, two methods from Human-Computer Interaction field, UX Curve and Attrakdiff, were used for measuring the UX of a non-interactive product. UX Curve was found suitable for evaluating changes in pruning shears' pleasantness after three months of use. Pragmatic product aspects mainly affected the changes in product pleasantness over time. The Pleasantness curve's shape related to the number of positive experiences, overall goodness and willingness to recommend the product. Interestingly, Attrakdiff measures proposed that in addition to pragmatic qualities, also hedonic qualities identification and beauty were related to customer loyalty.},

The costeffectiveness of the methods was evaluated using two factors: the amount of time required by 1) the researchers in employing the methods and 2) the participants to report their experiences with the method. Also, to determine the quality of the reported experiences, their content was compared between the methods. The results show that the electronic diary was more effective in revealing the experiences related to utility, missing functionalities, technical faults, dissatisfaction, and effectiveness.

   abstract = {Many of those who survive a stroke develop a gait disability known as stiff-knee gait (SKG). Characterized by reduced knee flexion angle during swing, people with SKG walk with poor energy efficiency and asymmetry due to the compensatory mechanisms required to clear the foot. Previous modeling studies have shown that knee flexion activity directly before the foot leaves the ground, and this should result in improved knee flexion angle during swing. The goal of this research is to physically test this hypothesis using robotic intervention. We developed a device that is capable of assisting knee flexion torque before swing but feels imperceptible (transparent) for the rest of the gait cycle. This device uses sheathed Bowden cable to control the deflection of a compliant torsional spring in a configuration known as a Series Elastic Remote Knee Actuator (SERKA). In this investigation, we describe the design and evaluation of SERKA, which includes a pilot experiment on stroke subjects. SERKA could supply a substantial torque (12 N · m) in less than 20 ms, with a maximum torque of 41 N · m. The device resisted knee flexion imperceptibly when desired, at less than 1 N · m rms torque during normal gait. With the remote location of the actuator, the user experiences a mass of only 1.2 kg on the knee. We found that the device was capable of increasing both peak knee flexion angle and velocity during gait in stroke subjects. Thus, the SERKA is a valid experimental device that selectively alters knee kinetics and kinematics in gait after stroke. © 2009 IEEE.},

This paper investigates the usability of different interaction modes for agricultural robot teleoperation. Specifically, we examined the overall influence of two types of output devices (PC screen, head mounted display), two types of peripheral vision support mechanisms (single view, multiple views), and two types of control input devices (PC keyboard, PS3 gamepad) on observed and perceived usability of a teleoperated agricultural sprayer. A modular user interface for teleoperating an agricultural robot sprayer was constructed and field-tested. Evaluation included eight interaction modes: the different combinations of the 3 factors. Thirty representative participants used each interaction mode to navigate the robot along a vineyard and spray grape clusters based on a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures experimental design. Objective metrics of the effectiveness and efficiency of the human-robot collaboration were collected. Participants also completed questionnaires related to their user experience with the system in each interaction mode. Results show that the most important factor for human-robot interface usability is the number and placement of views. The type of robot control input device was also a significant factor in certain dependents, whereas the effect of the screen output type was only significant on the participants’ perceived workload index. Specific recommendations for mobile field robot teleoperation to improve HRI awareness for the agricultural spraying task are presented.},

   abstract = {The focus of research into 5G networks to date has been largely on the required advances in network architectures, technologies, and infrastructures. Less effort has been put on the applications and services that will make use of and exploit the flexibility of 5G networks built upon the concept of software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). Media-based applications are amongst the most demanding services, requiring large bandwidths for high audio-visual quality, low-latency for interactivity, and sufficient infrastructure resources to deliver the computational power for running the media applications in the networked cloud. This paper presents a novel service virtualization platform (SVP), called 5G-MEDIA SVP, which leverages the principles of NFV and SDN to facilitate the development, deployment, and operation of media services on 5G networks. The platform offers an advanced cognitive management environment for the provisioning of network services (NSs) and media-related applications, which directly link their lifecycle management with user experience as well as optimization of infrastructure resource utilization. Another innovation of 5G-MEDIA SVP is the integration of serverless computing with media intensive applications in 5G networks, increasing cost effectiveness of operation and simplifying development and deployment time. The proposed SVP is being validated against three media use cases: 1) immersive virtual reality 3-D gaming application; 2) remote production of broadcast content incorporating user generated contents; and 3) dynamically adaptive content distribution networks for the intelligent distribution of ultrahigh definition content. The preliminary results of the 5G-MEDIA SVP platform evaluation are compared against current practice and show that the proposed platform provides enhanced functionality for the operators and infrastructure owners, while ensuring better NS performance to service providers and end users.},

   abstract = {Even as mobile devices have become increasingly powerful and popular among learners and instructors alike, research involving their comprehensive integration into educational laboratory activities remains largely unexplored. This paper discusses efforts to integrate vision-based measurement and control, augmented reality (AR), and multi-touch interaction on mobile devices in the development of Mixed-Reality Learning Environments (MRLE) that enhance interactions with laboratory test-beds for science and engineering education. A learner points her device at a laboratory test-bed fitted with visual markers while a mobile application supplies a live view of the experiment augmented with interactive media that aid in the visualization of concepts and promote learner engagement. As the learner manipulates the augmented media, her gestures are mapped to commands that alter the behavior of the test-bed on the fly. Running in the background of the mobile application are algorithms performing vision-based estimation and wireless control of the test-bed. In this way, the sensing, storage, computation, and communication (SSCC) capabilities of mobile devices are leveraged to relieve the need for laboratory-grade equipment, improving the cost-effectiveness and portability of platforms to conduct hands-on laboratories. We hypothesize that students using the MRLE platform demonstrate improvement in their knowledge of dynamic systems and control concepts and have generally favorable experiences using the platform. To validate the hypotheses concerning the educational effectiveness and user experience of the MRLEs, an evaluation was conducted with two classes of undergraduate students using an illustrative platform incorporating a tablet computer and motor test-bed to teach concepts of dynamic systems and control. Results of the evaluation validate the hypotheses. The benefits and drawbacks of the MRLEs observed throughout the study are discussed with respect to the traditional hands-on, virtual, and remote laboratory formats.},

   abstract = {Media facades are one prominent example of how new technologies currently augment urban spaces. At the same time, they offer new, ubiquitous opportunities for novel applications. To achieve a usable and enjoyable outcome, however, designing interaction with media façades demands a structured design process. In this paper, we present our experiences designing iRiS, a system for remote interaction with media façades. We approached the development following a user-centered design approach and addressing the process at two points with additional means: (1) using a purpose-built prototyping toolkit testing and exploring both, content and hardware before deploying the system on the actual façade and (2) experimental use and adaptation of user experience (UX) evaluation methods to investigate the users actions and emotions more holistically in this context. © 2012 ACM.},

The system provides users with the contextual information necessary to design embedded and situated data visualisations in a safe and convenient remote setting. We created system via a co-design process which involved people with little or no programming experience. Using the system, we illustrate three potential use cases for situated visualizations in the context of building maintenance, including: (1) on-site equipment debugging and diagnosis; (2) remote incident playback; and (3) operations simulations for future buildings. From feedback gathered during formative evaluations of our prototype tool with domain experts, we discuss implications, opportunities, and challenges for future in situ visualisation design tools.},
